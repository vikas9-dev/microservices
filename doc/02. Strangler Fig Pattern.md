# Strangler Fig Pattern: A Gradual Approach to Modernizing Legacy Systems üå±‚û°Ô∏èüå≥

The **Strangler Fig Pattern** is a software modernization strategy used to **incrementally replace a legacy system** with a **new system** while keeping the existing system running until it is fully replaced.

## **Why is it Called the "Strangler Fig" Pattern?** üåø

The pattern is inspired by the **strangler fig tree**, which grows around a host tree, gradually overtaking it until the original tree dies. Similarly, in software modernization, the **new system gradually replaces the old system piece by piece**, eventually eliminating the legacy system.

## **How the Strangler Fig Pattern Works**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify Components to Replace**

- Analyze the **legacy system** and identify **modules** that need replacement.
- Focus on **high-impact or frequently changing** parts first.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Develop New Components**

- Build new services using **modern architectures** (e.g., microservices, cloud-based systems).
- Ensure the new system **mimics the functionality** of the legacy module.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Route Traffic to the New System**

- Use **proxies, API gateways, or adapters** to redirect requests from the old system to the new components.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Gradually Replace More Modules**

- Over time, **migrate more features** to the new system while keeping the old system operational.
- Continuously test to ensure **seamless integration**.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Retire the Legacy System**

- Once all components are migrated, **decommission the old system**.

## **Example Scenario: Migrating a Monolithic Application to Microservices**

Imagine you have an **old monolithic banking application** and want to modernize it **without downtime**.

### **Step-by-Step Migration:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Start with a single service**: Migrate the **customer profile module** from the monolith to a new microservice.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Use an API Gateway**: Route **customer profile requests** to the new microservice while the rest of the system remains in the monolith.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Gradually migrate more modules**, such as loan processing, payment services, etc.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Over time, the old monolith is no longer needed** and is eventually turned off.

‚úÖ **Result:** The entire system is modernized without a **"big bang" migration** or downtime.

## **Advantages of the Strangler Fig Pattern**

‚úÖ **Zero Downtime** ‚Äì The system remains operational while being modernized.  
‚úÖ **Risk Reduction** ‚Äì Instead of a risky full replacement, migration happens **incrementally**.  
‚úÖ **Easier Debugging** ‚Äì New and old components can be tested side by side.  
‚úÖ **Faster Time to Market** ‚Äì New features can be deployed without waiting for the entire system rewrite.

## **When to Use the Strangler Fig Pattern?**

üîπ When **completely replacing a system at once is too risky**.  
üîπ When you need to **keep the old system running** while modernizing.  
üîπ When dealing with **monolithic applications** that need to be **broken into microservices**.  
üîπ When modernizing **legacy databases or APIs** without causing major disruptions.

## **Final Thoughts**

The **Strangler Fig Pattern** is a **practical approach** to **modernizing legacy systems** while ensuring business continuity. By **migrating components incrementally**, organizations can adopt **new technologies** without a complete system shutdown.
